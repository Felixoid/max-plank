Dear Sir or Madam,

I am writing to you since I am interested in a Ph.D. position in the area of the human dimension of the Earth system.

I graduated from Moscow State University in 2007 with the Diploma of bachelor and in 2009 with a master's Diploma. `Master's thesis was "Changes of some applied cold season climate characteristics in Russia," and I presented it on ERCA 2012.`

After graduation, I have been working for eleven years at the Institute of Geography, Russian Academy of Sciences. Three years ago, my family moved to Hamburg in connection with my husband's work. Currently, I continue to work remotely at the Institute of Geography on the project "The impact of climate change on the life activity of the population in Russia ("areas with special climatic conditions")." I assess Russian regions' transport accessibility and research the impact of warming and its consequences on the transport operation.

In parallel with my work at the Institute of Geography, I worked for six years at "Aviamettelecom of Roshydromet" (The Russian Federal Service for Hydrometeorology and Environmental Monitoring). My main task was researching the usage and demand for meteorological information in the economy. Our department in 2011-2014 organized meteorological support for the Winter Olympic Games in Sochi and the preceding world championships in winter sports. Working at Aviamettelecom gave me an understanding of how strongly people's lives depend on weather conditions and climate. I focused my study on climate change's impact on humans' living conditions and the economy's operation.

The main areas of my work at the Institute of Geography were:
- snow cover changes in Russia (frequency of snowfalls with different intensity, depth of snow cover, dates of the establishment of snow cover and its destruction);
- the spatial distribution and changes in the frequency of transitions of air temperature through 0Â°C;
- shifts in the dates of the beginning and end of the seasons.
I worked with large data sets of meteorological stations' data (using Python and SQL), carried out the data quality control, analyzed them in terms of climate change and economic gain/loss.

Since university, I have actively participated in field expeditions to the Black and White Sea coasts, the Kola peninsula, Central Caucasus, and Svalbard. I contributed to the instrumental studies of the winter and summer microclimates, the local winds' physics, and the soil temperature regime.

Over the past few years, I focused my interests on the impact of climate change on road transport in Russia. I researched the influence of weather phenomena on the accident rate of vehicles in Moscow. `I made a zonation of Russia territory according to road traffic and climatic conditions and investigated the displacement of the zoning boundaries due to climate change.`

I see my participation in IMPRS-ESM in the further study of weather and climate change's impact on the work of the road transport industry (or other sectors of the economy) and modeling the consequences of climate change. `I would like to research the short-term impacts of weather on automobile transport functioning (for example, investigation weather impact to the number of car accidents, traffic jams or freight traffic delays), determine the meteorological phenomena that have the greatest impact on the operation of the road transport industry, calculate the changes in their frequency in connection with climatic changes, to simulate climate change impacts and assessment of potential damage.`

The announced project looks like a good continuation of my recent activities and is posing interesting challenges to me, and I look forward to an opportunity to work in a broad interdisciplinary scientific research group at the Max Planck Institute for Meteorology and the University of Hamburg.
